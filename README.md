# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is a process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices. Ref https:/www.techtarget,com
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software engineering is process oriented disciple and incremental in approach. It encompases the whole software development lifecycle and is concerned with developing developing software products that are reliable, efficient and easy to use. On the other hand, traditional programming is is linear in approach, it focuses on writing a code and solving a specific problem.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
a) Requirement
b) Software testing
c) design
d) deployment
e) maintain
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
1. Agile model invloves multiple iterative development stages that aim to improve the output of every iteration. The Agile model is best suited for rapid delivery projects. Mike McCormick, 2012, http://elizabethlor.github.io/CSCI5828_Waterfall/documents/Waterfall_vs_Agile_Methodology.pdf
2. Waterfall model is rigid and with less adaptability consists of five phases to be completed sequentially in order to develop software solutions. Waterfall model is best suited for the development of programs that are already stable. Youseff Bassil, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1205.6904 , 2012.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirments engineering is defined as the area of systems engineering that deals with the process od developing and verifying the system requirement. it focuses on an essential concept in the implementation of systems engineering, that is need. Need in requirement engineering is identified and traced until its conclusion. Chris Hersman, Kim Fowlwer, Mission Critical and Safety Critical System handbook, 2010

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is essential to software developmemt as large software systems cannot be realised without it. What it means is it breaks down big problems into smaller managable parts. Andre van Hoek, Nicolas Lopez, A design perspective on modularity, https:/www.geekforgeek.org ,024
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
1. Unit testing is done on an individual unit isolated from the rest of the application
2. Intergrated testing: unlike unit testing where units are isolated, intergration testing units are combined and tested as a collective to ensure they work well together.
3. System testing: tests how well the software perfoms interms of speed, stability and resources.
4. Acceptance testing: this testing is done to evalute the application against real life scenarios. https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/software-testing 
 Why is testing crucial in software development? To ensure that the software is free of bugs and defects. Testing is crucial for detecting defects, maintaining and enhancing product quality and improve customer trust and satisfaction.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
It is the practise of tracking and managing changes to software codes.They are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Version system software tracks of modifications to codes in a special kind of database. 
examples of Version system software Git, bitkeeper, mercurial, apache subversion. Ref: https:/www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager's taskes are classified into two, that is Project planning and Project monitoring and control
Project Plannimg: software managers start planning immediatly after feasibility study is conducted and before the start of requirements analysis and specification phase. Project planning involves accurate estimation and execution of project activities, in order to avoid delays and rescheduling that may cost money and client confidence. Ref: www.Role and Responsibility of Project manager,geekforgeek.org. Also proper identification and allocation of tean they lead to ensure tasks are carried out with no hicups. 
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintainance is a post delivery activity, it is self explanatory as it involves the regular correction of errors, deleting and additing of capabilities, enhancement, addapting to changes in data requirements and improving performance ans userbility. (d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net) 
 An example of this is the regular update of banking apps to newer versions to improve their performance and add new features. Gets their customers to bank on their phones and less physical visits to bank branchs. this in turn minimize operational costs at branch level.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
1. Algorithmic bias
2. Weak security protection
3. Nagitive relationship between feature and impact.
4. Personal data collection
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
